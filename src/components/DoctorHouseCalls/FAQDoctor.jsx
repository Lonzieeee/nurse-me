      question: "What can I expect during a home visit?",
      answer: "A licensed doctor will visit you at home, perform an examination, ask about your symptoms, and provide treatment or prescriptions if needed. Each visit is personalized to your condition."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can a doctor arrive?",
      answer: "Availability depends on your location and doctor schedule, but most visits can be arranged within the same day, often within a few hours."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I book a home visit instead of going to the hospital?",
      answer: "Book a home visit for non-emergencies such as flu, fever, chronic condition reviews, follow-ups, or child checkups. Go to a hospital immediately for severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, heavy bleeding, or any life-threatening emergency."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need any special equipment at home?",
      answer: "No.Our doctors bring basic medical tools with them. If advanced equipment is required (e.g., scans, X-rays), they will advise on the nearest facility."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you provide prescriptions or medications during the visit?",
      answer: "Yes. Doctors can issue prescriptions, and in some cases provide medication on the spot. Follow-up prescriptions can also be renewed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I request the same doctor for follow-up visits?",
      answer: "Yes, whenever possible we assign the same doctor for continuity of care, unless your preferred doctor is unavailable."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel or reschedule a home visit?",
      answer: "Yes. You can cancel or reschedule through our booking system or support team. Early cancellations (2â€“4 hours before) are usually free, while late cancellations may incur a small fee. We'll do our best to accommodate rescheduling."
